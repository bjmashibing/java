<div class="block">Utility classes commonly useful in concurrent programming.  This
 package includes a few small standardized extensible frameworks, as
 well as some classes that provide useful functionality and are
 otherwise tedious or difficult to implement.  Here are brief
 descriptions of the main components.  See also the
 <a href="locks/package-summary.html"><code>java.util.concurrent.locks</code></a> and
 <a href="atomic/package-summary.html"><code>java.util.concurrent.atomic</code></a> packages.

 <h2>Executors</h2>

 <b>Interfaces.</b>

 <a href="Executor.html" title="interface in java.util.concurrent"><code>Executor</code></a> is a simple standardized
 interface for defining custom thread-like subsystems, including
 thread pools, asynchronous I/O, and lightweight task frameworks.
 Depending on which concrete Executor class is being used, tasks may
 execute in a newly created thread, an existing task-execution thread,
 or the thread calling <a href="Executor.html#execute(java.lang.Runnable)"><code>execute</code></a>, and may execute sequentially or concurrently.

 <a href="ExecutorService.html" title="interface in java.util.concurrent"><code>ExecutorService</code></a> provides a more
 complete asynchronous task execution framework.  An
 ExecutorService manages queuing and scheduling of tasks,
 and allows controlled shutdown.

 The <a href="ScheduledExecutorService.html" title="interface in java.util.concurrent"><code>ScheduledExecutorService</code></a>
 subinterface and associated interfaces add support for
 delayed and periodic task execution.  ExecutorServices
 provide methods arranging asynchronous execution of any
 function expressed as <a href="Callable.html" title="interface in java.util.concurrent"><code>Callable</code></a>,
 the result-bearing analog of <a href="../../lang/Runnable.html" title="interface in java.lang"><code>Runnable</code></a>.

 A <a href="Future.html" title="interface in java.util.concurrent"><code>Future</code></a> returns the results of
 a function, allows determination of whether execution has
 completed, and provides a means to cancel execution.

 A <a href="RunnableFuture.html" title="interface in java.util.concurrent"><code>RunnableFuture</code></a> is a <code>Future</code>
 that possesses a <code>run</code> method that upon execution,
 sets its results.

 <p>

 <b>Implementations.</b>

 Classes <a href="ThreadPoolExecutor.html" title="class in java.util.concurrent"><code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code></a> and
 <a href="ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.html" title="class in java.util.concurrent"><code>ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor</code></a>
 provide tunable, flexible thread pools.

 The <a href="Executors.html" title="class in java.util.concurrent"><code>Executors</code></a> class provides
 factory methods for the most common kinds and configurations
 of Executors, as well as a few utility methods for using
 them.  Other utilities based on <code>Executors</code> include the
 concrete class <a href="FutureTask.html" title="class in java.util.concurrent"><code>FutureTask</code></a>
 providing a common extensible implementation of Futures, and
 <a href="ExecutorCompletionService.html" title="class in java.util.concurrent"><code>ExecutorCompletionService</code></a>, that
 assists in coordinating the processing of groups of
 asynchronous tasks.

 <p>Class <a href="ForkJoinPool.html" title="class in java.util.concurrent"><code>ForkJoinPool</code></a> provides an
 Executor primarily designed for processing instances of <a href="ForkJoinTask.html" title="class in java.util.concurrent"><code>ForkJoinTask</code></a> and its subclasses.  These
 classes employ a work-stealing scheduler that attains high
 throughput for tasks conforming to restrictions that often hold in
 computation-intensive parallel processing.

 <h2>Queues</h2>

 The <a href="ConcurrentLinkedQueue.html" title="class in java.util.concurrent"><code>ConcurrentLinkedQueue</code></a> class
 supplies an efficient scalable thread-safe non-blocking FIFO queue.
 The <a href="ConcurrentLinkedDeque.html" title="class in java.util.concurrent"><code>ConcurrentLinkedDeque</code></a> class is
 similar, but additionally supports the <a href="../Deque.html" title="interface in java.util"><code>Deque</code></a>
 interface.

 <p>Five implementations in <code>java.util.concurrent</code> support
 the extended <a href="BlockingQueue.html" title="interface in java.util.concurrent"><code>BlockingQueue</code></a>
 interface, that defines blocking versions of put and take:
 <a href="LinkedBlockingQueue.html" title="class in java.util.concurrent"><code>LinkedBlockingQueue</code></a>,
 <a href="ArrayBlockingQueue.html" title="class in java.util.concurrent"><code>ArrayBlockingQueue</code></a>,
 <a href="SynchronousQueue.html" title="class in java.util.concurrent"><code>SynchronousQueue</code></a>,
 <a href="PriorityBlockingQueue.html" title="class in java.util.concurrent"><code>PriorityBlockingQueue</code></a>, and
 <a href="DelayQueue.html" title="class in java.util.concurrent"><code>DelayQueue</code></a>.
 The different classes cover the most common usage contexts
 for producer-consumer, messaging, parallel tasking, and
 related concurrent designs.

 <p>Extended interface <a href="TransferQueue.html" title="interface in java.util.concurrent"><code>TransferQueue</code></a>,
 and implementation <a href="LinkedTransferQueue.html" title="class in java.util.concurrent"><code>LinkedTransferQueue</code></a>
 introduce a synchronous <code>transfer</code> method (along with related
 features) in which a producer may optionally block awaiting its
 consumer.

 <p>The <a href="BlockingDeque.html" title="interface in java.util.concurrent"><code>BlockingDeque</code></a> interface
 extends <code>BlockingQueue</code> to support both FIFO and LIFO
 (stack-based) operations.
 Class <a href="LinkedBlockingDeque.html" title="class in java.util.concurrent"><code>LinkedBlockingDeque</code></a>
 provides an implementation.

 <h2>Timing</h2>

 The <a href="TimeUnit.html" title="enum in java.util.concurrent"><code>TimeUnit</code></a> class provides
 multiple granularities (including nanoseconds) for
 specifying and controlling time-out based operations.  Most
 classes in the package contain operations based on time-outs
 in addition to indefinite waits.  In all cases that
 time-outs are used, the time-out specifies the minimum time
 that the method should wait before indicating that it
 timed-out.  Implementations make a &quot;best effort&quot;
 to detect time-outs as soon as possible after they occur.
 However, an indefinite amount of time may elapse between a
 time-out being detected and a thread actually executing
 again after that time-out.  All methods that accept timeout
 parameters treat values less than or equal to zero to mean
 not to wait at all.  To wait "forever", you can use a value
 of <code>Long.MAX_VALUE</code>.

 <h2>Synchronizers</h2>

 Five classes aid common special-purpose synchronization idioms.
 <ul>

 <li><a href="Semaphore.html" title="class in java.util.concurrent"><code>Semaphore</code></a> is a classic concurrency tool.

 <li><a href="CountDownLatch.html" title="class in java.util.concurrent"><code>CountDownLatch</code></a> is a very simple yet
 very common utility for blocking until a given number of signals,
 events, or conditions hold.

 <li>A <a href="CyclicBarrier.html" title="class in java.util.concurrent"><code>CyclicBarrier</code></a> is a resettable
 multiway synchronization point useful in some styles of parallel
 programming.

 <li>A <a href="Phaser.html" title="class in java.util.concurrent"><code>Phaser</code></a> provides
 a more flexible form of barrier that may be used to control phased
 computation among multiple threads.

 <li>An <a href="Exchanger.html" title="class in java.util.concurrent"><code>Exchanger</code></a> allows two threads to
 exchange objects at a rendezvous point, and is useful in several
 pipeline designs.

 </ul>

 <h2>Concurrent Collections</h2>

 Besides Queues, this package supplies Collection implementations
 designed for use in multithreaded contexts:
 <a href="ConcurrentHashMap.html" title="class in java.util.concurrent"><code>ConcurrentHashMap</code></a>,
 <a href="ConcurrentSkipListMap.html" title="class in java.util.concurrent"><code>ConcurrentSkipListMap</code></a>,
 <a href="ConcurrentSkipListSet.html" title="class in java.util.concurrent"><code>ConcurrentSkipListSet</code></a>,
 <a href="CopyOnWriteArrayList.html" title="class in java.util.concurrent"><code>CopyOnWriteArrayList</code></a>, and
 <a href="CopyOnWriteArraySet.html" title="class in java.util.concurrent"><code>CopyOnWriteArraySet</code></a>.
 When many threads are expected to access a given collection, a
 <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code> is normally preferable to a synchronized
 <code>HashMap</code>, and a <code>ConcurrentSkipListMap</code> is normally
 preferable to a synchronized <code>TreeMap</code>.
 A <code>CopyOnWriteArrayList</code> is preferable to a synchronized
 <code>ArrayList</code> when the expected number of reads and traversals
 greatly outnumber the number of updates to a list.

 <p>The "Concurrent" prefix used with some classes in this package
 is a shorthand indicating several differences from similar
 "synchronized" classes.  For example <code>java.util.Hashtable</code> and
 <code>Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap())</code> are
 synchronized.  But <a href="ConcurrentHashMap.html" title="class in java.util.concurrent"><code>ConcurrentHashMap</code></a> is "concurrent".  A
 concurrent collection is thread-safe, but not governed by a
 single exclusion lock.  In the particular case of
 ConcurrentHashMap, it safely permits any number of
 concurrent reads as well as a large number of concurrent
 writes.  "Synchronized" classes can be useful when you need
 to prevent all access to a collection via a single lock, at
 the expense of poorer scalability.  In other cases in which
 multiple threads are expected to access a common collection,
 "concurrent" versions are normally preferable.  And
 unsynchronized collections are preferable when either
 collections are unshared, or are accessible only when
 holding other locks.

 <p id="Weakly">Most concurrent Collection implementations
 (including most Queues) also differ from the usual <code>java.util</code>
 conventions in that their <a href="../Iterator.html" title="interface in java.util">Iterators</a>
 and <a href="../Spliterator.html" title="interface in java.util">Spliterators</a> provide
 <em>weakly consistent</em> rather than fast-fail traversal:
 <ul>
 <li>they may proceed concurrently with other operations
 <li>they will never throw <a href="../ConcurrentModificationException.html" title="class in java.util"><code>ConcurrentModificationException</code></a>
 <li>they are guaranteed to traverse elements as they existed upon
 construction exactly once, and may (but are not guaranteed to)
 reflect any modifications subsequent to construction.
 </ul>

 <h2 id="MemoryVisibility">Memory Consistency Properties</h2>

 <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se11/html/jls-17.html#jls-17.4.5">
 Chapter 17 of
 <cite>The Java&trade; Language Specification</cite></a> defines the
 <i>happens-before</i> relation on memory operations such as reads and
 writes of shared variables.  The results of a write by one thread are
 guaranteed to be visible to a read by another thread only if the write
 operation <i>happens-before</i> the read operation.  The
 <code>synchronized</code> and <code>volatile</code> constructs, as well as the
 <code>Thread.start()</code> and <code>Thread.join()</code> methods, can form
 <i>happens-before</i> relationships.  In particular:

 <ul>
   <li>Each action in a thread <i>happens-before</i> every action in that
   thread that comes later in the program's order.

   <li>An unlock (<code>synchronized</code> block or method exit) of a
   monitor <i>happens-before</i> every subsequent lock (<code>synchronized</code>
   block or method entry) of that same monitor.  And because
   the <i>happens-before</i> relation is transitive, all actions
   of a thread prior to unlocking <i>happen-before</i> all actions
   subsequent to any thread locking that monitor.

   <li>A write to a <code>volatile</code> field <i>happens-before</i> every
   subsequent read of that same field.  Writes and reads of
   <code>volatile</code> fields have similar memory consistency effects
   as entering and exiting monitors, but do <em>not</em> entail
   mutual exclusion locking.

   <li>A call to <code>start</code> on a thread <i>happens-before</i> any
   action in the started thread.

   <li>All actions in a thread <i>happen-before</i> any other thread
   successfully returns from a <code>join</code> on that thread.

 </ul>

 The methods of all classes in <code>java.util.concurrent</code> and its
 subpackages extend these guarantees to higher-level
 synchronization.  In particular:

 <ul>

   <li>Actions in a thread prior to placing an object into any concurrent
   collection <i>happen-before</i> actions subsequent to the access or
   removal of that element from the collection in another thread.

   <li>Actions in a thread prior to the submission of a <code>Runnable</code>
   to an <code>Executor</code> <i>happen-before</i> its execution begins.
   Similarly for <code>Callables</code> submitted to an <code>ExecutorService</code>.

   <li>Actions taken by the asynchronous computation represented by a
   <code>Future</code> <i>happen-before</i> actions subsequent to the
   retrieval of the result via <code>Future.get()</code> in another thread.

   <li>Actions prior to "releasing" synchronizer methods such as
   <code>Lock.unlock</code>, <code>Semaphore.release</code>, and
   <code>CountDownLatch.countDown</code> <i>happen-before</i> actions
   subsequent to a successful "acquiring" method such as
   <code>Lock.lock</code>, <code>Semaphore.acquire</code>,
   <code>Condition.await</code>, and <code>CountDownLatch.await</code> on the
   same synchronizer object in another thread.

   <li>For each pair of threads that successfully exchange objects via
   an <code>Exchanger</code>, actions prior to the <code>exchange()</code>
   in each thread <i>happen-before</i> those subsequent to the
   corresponding <code>exchange()</code> in another thread.

   <li>Actions prior to calling <code>CyclicBarrier.await</code> and
   <code>Phaser.awaitAdvance</code> (as well as its variants)
   <i>happen-before</i> actions performed by the barrier action, and
   actions performed by the barrier action <i>happen-before</i> actions
   subsequent to a successful return from the corresponding <code>await</code>
   in other threads.
