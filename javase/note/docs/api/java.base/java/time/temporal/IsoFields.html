<div class="block">Fields and units specific to the ISO-8601 calendar system,
 including quarter-of-year and week-based-year.
 <p>
 This class defines fields and units that are specific to the ISO calendar system.

 <h3>Quarter of year</h3>
 The ISO-8601 standard is based on the standard civic 12 month year.
 This is commonly divided into four quarters, often abbreviated as Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4.
 <p>
 January, February and March are in Q1.
 April, May and June are in Q2.
 July, August and September are in Q3.
 October, November and December are in Q4.
 <p>
 The complete date is expressed using three fields:
 <ul>
 <li><a href="#DAY_OF_QUARTER"><code>DAY_OF_QUARTER</code></a> - the day within the quarter, from 1 to 90, 91 or 92
 <li><a href="#QUARTER_OF_YEAR"><code>QUARTER_OF_YEAR</code></a> - the quarter within the year, from 1 to 4
 <li><a href="ChronoField.html#YEAR"><code>YEAR</code></a> - the standard ISO year
 </ul>

 <h3>Week based years</h3>
 The ISO-8601 standard was originally intended as a data interchange format,
 defining a string format for dates and times. However, it also defines an
 alternate way of expressing the date, based on the concept of week-based-year.
 <p>
 The date is expressed using three fields:
 <ul>
 <li><a href="ChronoField.html#DAY_OF_WEEK"><code>DAY_OF_WEEK</code></a> - the standard field defining the
  day-of-week from Monday (1) to Sunday (7)
 <li><a href="#WEEK_OF_WEEK_BASED_YEAR"><code>WEEK_OF_WEEK_BASED_YEAR</code></a> - the week within the week-based-year
 <li><a href="#WEEK_BASED_YEAR"><code>WEEK_BASED_YEAR</code></a> - the week-based-year
 </ul>
 The week-based-year itself is defined relative to the standard ISO proleptic year.
 It differs from the standard year in that it always starts on a Monday.
 <p>
 The first week of a week-based-year is the first Monday-based week of the standard
 ISO year that has at least 4 days in the new year.
 <ul>
 <li>If January 1st is Monday then week 1 starts on January 1st
 <li>If January 1st is Tuesday then week 1 starts on December 31st of the previous standard year
 <li>If January 1st is Wednesday then week 1 starts on December 30th of the previous standard year
 <li>If January 1st is Thursday then week 1 starts on December 29th of the previous standard year
 <li>If January 1st is Friday then week 1 starts on January 4th
 <li>If January 1st is Saturday then week 1 starts on January 3rd
 <li>If January 1st is Sunday then week 1 starts on January 2nd
 </ul>
 There are 52 weeks in most week-based years, however on occasion there are 53 weeks.
 <p>
 For example:

<h4>DAY_OF_QUARTER</h4>
<pre>public static final&nbsp;<a href="TemporalField.html" title="interface in java.time.temporal">TemporalField</a> DAY_OF_QUARTER</pre>
<div class="block">The field that represents the day-of-quarter.
 <p>
 This field allows the day-of-quarter value to be queried and set.
 The day-of-quarter has values from 1 to 90 in Q1 of a standard year, from 1 to 91
 in Q1 of a leap year, from 1 to 91 in Q2 and from 1 to 92 in Q3 and Q4.
 <p>
 The day-of-quarter can only be calculated if the day-of-year, month-of-year and year
 are available.
 <p>
 When setting this field, the value is allowed to be partially lenient, taking any
 value from 1 to 92. If the quarter has less than 92 days, then day 92, and
 potentially day 91, is in the following quarter.
 <p>
 In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a year,
 quarter-of-year and day-of-quarter.
 <p>
 In <a href="../format/ResolverStyle.html#STRICT">strict mode</a>, all three fields are
 validated against their range of valid values. The day-of-quarter field
 is validated from 1 to 90, 91 or 92 depending on the year and quarter.
 <p>
 In <a href="../format/ResolverStyle.html#SMART">smart mode</a>, all three fields are
 validated against their range of valid values. The day-of-quarter field is
 validated between 1 and 92, ignoring the actual range based on the year and quarter.
 If the day-of-quarter exceeds the actual range by one day, then the resulting date
 is one day later. If the day-of-quarter exceeds the actual range by two days,
 then the resulting date is two days later.
 <p>
 In <a href="../format/ResolverStyle.html#LENIENT">lenient mode</a>, only the year is validated
 against the range of valid values. The resulting date is calculated equivalent to
 the following three stage approach. First, create a date on the first of January
 in the requested year. Then take the quarter-of-year, subtract one, and add the
 amount in quarters to the date. Finally, take the day-of-quarter, subtract one,
 and add the amount in days to the date.

 <p>
 This field allows the quarter-of-year value to be queried and set.
 The quarter-of-year has values from 1 to 4.
 <p>
 The quarter-of-year can only be calculated if the month-of-year is available.

<div class="block">The field that represents the week-of-week-based-year.
 <p>
 This field allows the week of the week-based-year value to be queried and set.
 The week-of-week-based-year has values from 1 to 52, or 53 if the
 week-based-year has 53 weeks.
 <p>
 In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a
 week-based-year, week-of-week-based-year and day-of-week.
 <p>
 In <a href="../format/ResolverStyle.html#STRICT">strict mode</a>, all three fields are
 validated against their range of valid values. The week-of-week-based-year
 field is validated from 1 to 52 or 53 depending on the week-based-year.
 <p>
 In <a href="../format/ResolverStyle.html#SMART">smart mode</a>, all three fields are
 validated against their range of valid values. The week-of-week-based-year
 field is validated between 1 and 53, ignoring the week-based-year.
 If the week-of-week-based-year is 53, but the week-based-year only has
 52 weeks, then the resulting date is in week 1 of the following week-based-year.
 <p>
 In <a href="../format/ResolverStyle.html#LENIENT">lenient mode</a>, only the week-based-year
 is validated against the range of valid values. If the day-of-week is outside
 the range 1 to 7, then the resulting date is adjusted by a suitable number of
 weeks to reduce the day-of-week to the range 1 to 7. If the week-of-week-based-year
 value is outside the range 1 to 52, then any excess weeks are added or subtracted
 from the resulting date.
