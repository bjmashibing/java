/**
 * A validator for application-specific objects.
 *
 * <p>This interface is totally divorced from any infrastructure
 * or context; that is to say it is not coupled to validating
 * only objects in the web tier, the data-access tier, or the
 * whatever-tier. As such it is amenable to being used in any layer
 * of an application, and supports the encapsulation of validation
 * logic as a first-class citizen in its own right.
 *
 * <p>Find below a simple but complete {@code Validator}
 * implementation, which validates that the various {@link String}
 * properties of a {@code UserLogin} instance are not empty
 * (that is they are not {@code null} and do not consist
 * wholly of whitespace), and that any password that is present is
 * at least {@code 'MINIMUM_PASSWORD_LENGTH'} characters in length.
 *
 * <pre class="code"> public class UserLoginValidator implements Validator {
 *
 *    private static final int MINIMUM_PASSWORD_LENGTH = 6;
 *
 *    public boolean supports(Class clazz) {
 *       return UserLogin.class.isAssignableFrom(clazz);
 *    }
 *
 *    public void validate(Object target, Errors errors) {
 *       ValidationUtils.rejectIfEmptyOrWhitespace(errors, "userName", "field.required");
 *       ValidationUtils.rejectIfEmptyOrWhitespace(errors, "password", "field.required");
 *       UserLogin login = (UserLogin) target;
 *       if (login.getPassword() != null
 *             && login.getPassword().trim().length() < MINIMUM_PASSWORD_LENGTH) {
 *          errors.rejectValue("password", "field.min.length",
 *                new Object[]{Integer.valueOf(MINIMUM_PASSWORD_LENGTH)},
 *                "The password must be at least [" + MINIMUM_PASSWORD_LENGTH + "] characters in length.");
 *       }
 *    }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>See also the Spring reference manual for a fuller discussion of
 * the {@code Validator} interface and its role in an enterprise
 * application.
