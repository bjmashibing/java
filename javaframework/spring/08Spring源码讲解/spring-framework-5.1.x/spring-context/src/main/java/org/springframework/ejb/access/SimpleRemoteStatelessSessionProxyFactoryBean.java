/**
 * Convenient {@link FactoryBean} for remote SLSB proxies.
 * Designed for EJB 2.x, but works for EJB 3 Session Beans as well.
 *
 * <p>See {@link org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectLocator} for info on
 * how to specify the JNDI location of the target EJB.
 *
 * <p>If you want control over interceptor chaining, use an AOP ProxyFactoryBean
 * with SimpleRemoteSlsbInvokerInterceptor rather than rely on this class.
 *
 * <p>In a bean container, this class is normally best used as a singleton. However,
 * if that bean container pre-instantiates singletons (as do the XML ApplicationContext
 * variants) you may have a problem if the bean container is loaded before the EJB
 * container loads the target EJB. That is because by default the JNDI lookup will be
 * performed in the init method of this class and cached, but the EJB will not have been
 * bound at the target location yet. The best solution is to set the lookupHomeOnStartup
 * property to false, in which case the home will be fetched on first access to the EJB.
 * (This flag is only true by default for backwards compatibility reasons).
 *
 * <p>This proxy factory is typically used with an RMI business interface, which serves
 * as super-interface of the EJB component interface. Alternatively, this factory
 * can also proxy a remote SLSB with a matching non-RMI business interface, i.e. an
 * interface that mirrors the EJB business methods but does not declare RemoteExceptions.
 * In the latter case, RemoteExceptions thrown by the EJB stub will automatically get
 * converted to Spring's unchecked RemoteAccessException.
