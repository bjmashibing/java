 * Simple task executor interface that abstracts the execution

 * such as: synchronous, asynchronous, using a thread pool, and more.
 *
 * <p>Equivalent to JDK 1.5's {@link java.util.concurrent.Executor}
 * interface; extending it now in Spring 3.0, so that clients may declare
 * a dependency on an Executor and receive any TaskExecutor implementation.
 * This interface remains separate from the standard Executor interface
 * mainly for backwards compatibility with JDK 1.4 in Spring 2.x.
