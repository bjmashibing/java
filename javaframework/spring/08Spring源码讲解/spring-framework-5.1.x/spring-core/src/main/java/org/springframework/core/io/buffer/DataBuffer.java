/**
 * Basic abstraction over byte buffers.
 *
 * <p>{@code DataBuffer}s has a separate {@linkplain #readPosition() read} and
 * {@linkplain #writePosition() write} position, as opposed to {@code ByteBuffer}'s
 * single {@linkplain ByteBuffer#position() position}. As such, the {@code DataBuffer}
 * does not require a {@linkplain ByteBuffer#flip() flip} to read after writing. In general,
 * the following invariant holds for the read and write positions, and the capacity:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *     <tt>0</tt> <tt>&lt;=</tt>
 *     <i>readPosition</i> <tt>&lt;=</tt>
 *     <i>writePosition</i> <tt>&lt;=</tt>
 *     <i>capacity</i>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>The {@linkplain #capacity() capacity} of a {@code DataBuffer} is expanded on demand,
 * similar to {@code StringBuilder}.
 *
 * <p>The main purpose of the {@code DataBuffer} abstraction is to provide a convenient wrapper
 * around {@link ByteBuffer} which is similar to Netty's {@link io.netty.buffer.ByteBuf} but
 * can also be used on non-Netty platforms (i.e. Servlet containers).
