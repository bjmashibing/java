 * Strategy interface for loading an {@link ApplicationContext application context}

 * <p><b>Note</b>: as of Spring 3.1, implement {@link SmartContextLoader} instead
 * of this interface in order to provide support for annotated classes, active
 * bean definition profiles, and application context initializers.
 *
 * <p>Clients of a ContextLoader should call
 * {@link #processLocations(Class, String...) processLocations()} prior to
 * calling {@link #loadContext(String...) loadContext()} in case the
 * ContextLoader provides custom support for modifying or generating locations.
 * The results of {@link #processLocations(Class, String...) processLocations()}
 * should then be supplied to {@link #loadContext(String...) loadContext()}.
 *
 * <p>Concrete implementations must provide a {@code public} no-args constructor.
 *
 * <p>Spring provides the following out-of-the-box implementations:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link org.springframework.test.context.support.GenericXmlContextLoader GenericXmlContextLoader}</li>
 * <li>{@link org.springframework.test.context.support.GenericPropertiesContextLoader GenericPropertiesContextLoader}</li>
