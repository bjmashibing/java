/**
 * JavaBean that describes a scheduled TimerListener, consisting of
 * the TimerListener itself (or a Runnable to create a TimerListener for)
 * and a delay plus period. Period needs to be specified;
 * there is no point in a default for it.
 *
 * <p>The CommonJ TimerManager does not offer more sophisticated scheduling
 * options such as cron expressions. Consider using Quartz for such
 * advanced needs.
 *
 * <p>Note that the TimerManager uses a TimerListener instance that is
 * shared between repeated executions, in contrast to Quartz which
 * instantiates a new Job for each execution.
