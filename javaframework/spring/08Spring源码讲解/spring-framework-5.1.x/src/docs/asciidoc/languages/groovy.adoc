= Apache Groovy

Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed, and dynamic language, with static-typing and static
compilation capabilities. It offers a concise syntax and integrates smoothly with any
existing Java application.

The Spring Framework provides a dedicated `ApplicationContext` that supports a Groovy-based
Bean Definition DSL. For more details, see
<<core.adoc#groovy-bean-definition-dsl, The Groovy Bean Definition DSL>>.

Further support for Groovy, including beans written in Groovy, refreshable script beans,
and more is available in <<dynamic-language>>.
