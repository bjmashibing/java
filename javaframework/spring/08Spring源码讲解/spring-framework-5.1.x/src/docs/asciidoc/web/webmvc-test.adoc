This section summarizes the options available in `spring-test` for Spring MVC applications.

* Servlet API Mocks: Mock implementations of Servlet API contracts for unit testing controllers,
filters, and other web components. See <<testing.adoc#mock-objects-servlet, Servlet API>>
mock objects for more details.

* TestContext Framework: Support for loading Spring configuration in JUnit and TestNG tests,
including efficient caching of the loaded configuration across test methods and support for
loading a `WebApplicationContext` with a `MockServletContext`.
See <<testing.adoc#testcontext-framework,TestContext Framework>> for more details.

* Spring MVC Test: A framework, also known as `MockMvc`, for testing annotated controllers
through the `DispatcherServlet` (that is, supporting annotations), complete with the
Spring MVC infrastructure but without an HTTP server.
See <<testing.adoc#spring-mvc-test-framework, Spring MVC Test>> for more details.

* Client-side REST: `spring-test` provides a `MockRestServiceServer` that you can use as
a mock server for testing client-side code that internally uses the `RestTemplate`.
See <<testing.adoc#spring-mvc-test-client, Client REST Tests>> for more details.

* `WebTestClient`: Built for testing WebFlux applications, but it can also be used for
end-to-end integration testing, to any server, over an HTTP connection. It is a
non-blocking, reactive client and is well suited for testing asynchronous and streaming
scenarios.
