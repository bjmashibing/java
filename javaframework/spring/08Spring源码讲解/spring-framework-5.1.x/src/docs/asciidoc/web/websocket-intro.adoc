= Introduction to WebSocket

The WebSocket protocol, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455[RFC 6455], provides a standardized
way to establish a full-duplex, two-way communication channel between client and server
over a single TCP connection. It is a different TCP protocol from HTTP but is designed to
work over HTTP, using ports 80 and 443 and allowing re-use of existing firewall rules.

A WebSocket interaction begins with an HTTP request that uses the HTTP `Upgrade` header
to upgrade or, in this case, to switch to the WebSocket protocol. The following example
shows such an interaction:

====
[source,yaml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	GET /spring-websocket-portfolio/portfolio HTTP/1.1
	Host: localhost:8080
	Upgrade: websocket <1>
	Connection: Upgrade <2>
	Sec-WebSocket-Key: Uc9l9TMkWGbHFD2qnFHltg==
	Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: v10.stomp, v11.stomp
	Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
	Origin: http://localhost:8080
----
<1> The `Upgrade` header.
<2> Using the `Upgrade` connection.
====

Instead of the usual 200 status code, a server with WebSocket support returns output
similar to the following:

====
[source,yaml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols <1>
	Upgrade: websocket
	Connection: Upgrade
	Sec-WebSocket-Accept: 1qVdfYHU9hPOl4JYYNXF623Gzn0=
	Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: v10.stomp
----
<1> Protocol switch
====

After a successful handshake, the TCP socket underlying the HTTP upgrade request remains
open for both the client and the server to continue to send and receive messages.

A complete introduction of how WebSockets work is beyond the scope of this document.
See RFC 6455, the WebSocket chapter of HTML5, or any of the many introductions and
tutorials on the Web.

Note that, if a WebSocket server is running behind a web server (e.g. nginx), you
likely need to configure it to pass WebSocket upgrade requests on to the WebSocket
server. Likewise, if the application runs in a cloud environment, check the
instructions of the cloud provider related to WebSocket support.




[[websocket-intro-architecture]]
== HTTP Versus WebSocket

Even though WebSocket is designed to be HTTP-compatible and starts with an HTTP request,
it is important to understand that the two protocols lead to very different
architectures and application programming models.

In HTTP and REST, an application is modeled as many URLs. To interact with the application,
clients access those URLs, request-response style. Servers route requests to the
appropriate handler based on the HTTP URL, method, and headers.

By contrast, in WebSockets, there is usually only one URL for the initial connect.
Subsequently, all application messages flow on that same TCP connection. This points to
an entirely different asynchronous, event-driven, messaging architecture.

WebSocket is also a low-level transport protocol, which, unlike HTTP, does not prescribe
any semantics to the content of messages. That means that there is no way to route or process
a message unless the client and the server agree on message semantics.

WebSocket clients and servers can negotiate the use of a higher-level, messaging protocol
(for example, STOMP), through the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header on the HTTP handshake request.
In the absence of that, they need to come up with their own conventions.




[[websocket-intro-when-to-use]]
== When to Use WebSockets

WebSockets can make a web page be dynamic and interactive. However, in many cases,
a combination of Ajax and HTTP streaming or long polling can provide a simple and
effective solution.

For example, news, mail, and social feeds need to update dynamically, but it may be
perfectly okay to do so every few minutes. Collaboration, games, and financial apps, on
the other hand, need to be much closer to real-time.

Latency alone is not a deciding factor. If the volume of messages is relatively low (for example,
monitoring network failures) HTTP streaming or polling can provide an effective solution.
It is the combination of low latency, high frequency, and high volume that make the best
case for the use of WebSocket.

Keep in mind also that over the Internet, restrictive proxies that are outside of your control
may preclude WebSocket interactions, either because they are not configured to pass on the
`Upgrade` header or because they close long-lived connections that appear idle. This
means that the use of WebSocket for internal applications within the firewall is a more
straightforward decision than it is for public facing applications.
