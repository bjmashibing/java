[[webflux-cors]]
= CORS
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-cors, Same as in Spring MVC>>#

Spring WebFlux lets you handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). This section
describes how to do so.




[[webflux-cors-intro]]
== Introduction
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-cors-intro, Same as in Spring MVC>>#

For security reasons, browsers prohibit AJAX calls to resources outside the current origin.
For example, you could have your bank account in one tab and evil.com in another. Scripts
from evil.com should not be able to make AJAX requests to your bank API with your
credentials -- for example, withdrawing money from your account!

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/[W3C specification]
implemented by https://caniuse.com/#feat=cors[most browsers] that lets you specify
what kind of cross-domain requests are authorized, rather than using less secure and less
powerful workarounds based on IFRAME or JSONP.




[[webflux-cors-processing]]
== Processing
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-cors-processing, Same as in Spring MVC>>#

The CORS specification distinguishes between preflight, simple, and actual requests.
To learn how CORS works, you can read
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS[this article], among
many others, or see the specification for more details.

Spring WebFlux `HandlerMapping` implementations provide built-in support for CORS. After successfully
mapping a request to a handler, a `HandlerMapping` checks the CORS configuration for the
given request and handler and takes further actions. Preflight requests are handled
directly, while simple and actual CORS requests are intercepted, validated, and have the
required CORS response headers set.

In order to enable cross-origin requests (that is, the `Origin` header is present and
differs from the host of the request), you need to have some explicitly declared CORS
configuration. If no matching CORS configuration is found, preflight requests are
rejected. No CORS headers are added to the responses of simple and actual CORS requests
and, consequently, browsers reject them.

Each `HandlerMapping` can be
{api-spring-framework}/web/reactive/handler/AbstractHandlerMapping.html#setCorsConfigurations-java.util.Map-[configured]
individually with URL pattern-based `CorsConfiguration` mappings. In most cases, applications
use the WebFlux Java configuration to declare such mappings, which results in a single,
global map passed to all `HadlerMappping` implementations.

You can combine global CORS configuration at the `HandlerMapping` level with more
fine-grained, handler-level CORS configuration. For example, annotated controllers can use
class- or method-level `@CrossOrigin` annotations (other handlers can implement
`CorsConfigurationSource`).

The rules for combining global and local configuration are generally additive -- for example,
all global and all local origins. For those attributes where only a single value can be
accepted, such as `allowCredentials` and `maxAge`, the local overrides the global value. See
{api-spring-framework}/web/cors/CorsConfiguration.html#combine-org.springframework.web.cors.CorsConfiguration-[`CorsConfiguration#combine(CorsConfiguration)`]
for more details.

[[webflux-cors-controller]]
== `@CrossOrigin`
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-cors-controller, Same as in Spring MVC>>#

The {api-spring-framework}/web/bind/annotation/CrossOrigin.html[`@CrossOrigin`]
annotation enables cross-origin requests on annotated controller methods, as the
following example shows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/account")
public class AccountController {

	@CrossOrigin
	@GetMapping("/{id}")
	public Mono<Account> retrieve(@PathVariable Long id) {
		// ...
	}

	@DeleteMapping("/{id}")
	public Mono<Void> remove(@PathVariable Long id) {
		// ...
	}
}
----
====

By default, `@CrossOrigin` allows:

* All origins.
* All headers.
* All HTTP methods to which the controller method is mapped.


`allowedCredentials` is not enabled by default, since that establishes a trust level
that exposes sensitive user-specific information (such as cookies and CSRF tokens) and
should be used only where appropriate.

`maxAge` is set to 30 minutes.

`@CrossOrigin` is supported at the class level, too, and inherited by all methods.
The following example specifies a certain domain and sets `maxAge` to an hour:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@CrossOrigin(origins = "https://domain2.com", maxAge = 3600)
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/account")
public class AccountController {

	@GetMapping("/{id}")
	public Mono<Account> retrieve(@PathVariable Long id) {
		// ...
	}

	@DeleteMapping("/{id}")
	public Mono<Void> remove(@PathVariable Long id) {
		// ...
	}
}
----
====

You can use `@CrossOrigin` at both the class and the method level,
as the following example shows:
====

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@CrossOrigin(maxAge = 3600) <1>
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/account")
public class AccountController {

	@CrossOrigin("https://domain2.com") <2>
	@GetMapping("/{id}")
	public Mono<Account> retrieve(@PathVariable Long id) {
		// ...
	}

	@DeleteMapping("/{id}")
	public Mono<Void> remove(@PathVariable Long id) {
		// ...
	}
}
----
<1> Using `@CrossOrigin` at the class level.
<2> Using `@CrossOrigin` at the method level.

[[webflux-cors-global]]
== Global Configuration
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-cors-global, Same as in Spring MVC>>#

In addition to fine-grained, controller method-level configuration, you probably want to
define some global CORS configuration, too. You can set URL-based `CorsConfiguration`
mappings individually on any `HandlerMapping`. Most applications, however, use the
WebFlux Java configuration to do that.

By default global configuration enables the following:

* All origins.
* All headers.
* `GET`, `HEAD`, and `POST` methods.

`allowedCredentials` is not enabled by default, since that establishes a trust level
that exposes sensitive user-specific information( such as cookies and CSRF tokens) and
should be used only where appropriate.

`maxAge` is set to 30 minutes.

To enable CORS in the WebFlux Java configuration, you can use the `CorsRegistry` callback,
as the following example shows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@Configuration
@EnableWebFlux
public class WebConfig implements WebFluxConfigurer {

	@Override
	public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {

		registry.addMapping("/api/**")
			.allowedOrigins("https://domain2.com")
			.allowedMethods("PUT", "DELETE")
			.allowedHeaders("header1", "header2", "header3")
			.exposedHeaders("header1", "header2")
			.allowCredentials(true).maxAge(3600);

		// Add more mappings...
	}
}
----

[[webflux-cors-webfilter]]
== CORS `WebFilter`
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-cors-filter, Same as in Spring MVC>>#

You can apply CORS support through the built-in
{api-spring-framework}/web/cors/reactive/CorsWebFilter.html[`CorsWebFilter`], which is a
good fit with <<webflux-fn, functional endpoints>>.

NOTE: If you try to use the `CorsFilter` with Spring Security, keep in mind that Spring
Security has
https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#cors[built-in support]
for CORS.

To configure the filter, you can declare a `CorsWebFilter` bean and pass a
`CorsConfigurationSource` to its constructor, as the following example shows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim"]
----
@Bean
CorsWebFilter corsFilter() {

	CorsConfiguration config = new CorsConfiguration();

	// Possibly...
	// config.applyPermitDefaultValues()

	config.setAllowCredentials(true);
	config.addAllowedOrigin("https://domain1.com");
	config.addAllowedHeader("*");
	config.addAllowedMethod("*");

	UrlBasedCorsConfigurationSource source = new UrlBasedCorsConfigurationSource();
	source.registerCorsConfiguration("/**", config);

	return new CorsWebFilter(source);
}
