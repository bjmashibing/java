[[webflux-fn]]
= Functional Endpoints

Spring WebFlux includes WebFlux.fn, a lightweight functional programming model in which functions
are used to route and handle requests and contracts are designed for immutability.
It is an alternative to the annotation-based programming model but otherwise runs on
the same <<web-reactive.adoc#webflux-reactive-spring-web>> foundation.




[[webflux-fn-overview]]
== Overview

In WebFlux.fn, an HTTP request is handled with a `HandlerFunction`: a function that takes
`ServerRequest` and returns a delayed `ServerResponse` (i.e. `Mono<ServerResponse>`).
Both the request as the response object have immutable contracts that offer JDK 8-friendly
access to the HTTP request and response.
`HandlerFunction` is the equivalent of the body of a `@RequestMapping` method in the
annotation-based programming model.

Incoming requests are routed to a handler function with a `RouterFunction`: a function that
takes `ServerRequest` and returns a delayed `HandlerFunction` (i.e. `Mono<HandlerFunction>`).
When the router function matches, a handler function is returned; otherwise an empty Mono.
`RouterFunction` is the equivalent of a `@RequestMapping` annotation, but with the major
difference that router functions provide not just data, but also behavior.

`RouterFunctions.route()` provides a router builder that facilitates the creation of routers,
as the following example shows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
import static org.springframework.http.MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON;
import static org.springframework.web.reactive.function.server.RequestPredicates.*;
import static org.springframework.web.reactive.function.server.RouterFunctions.route;

PersonRepository repository = ...
PersonHandler handler = new PersonHandler(repository);

RouterFunction<ServerResponse> route = route()
	.GET("/person/{id}", accept(APPLICATION_JSON), handler::getPerson)
	.GET("/person", accept(APPLICATION_JSON), handler::listPeople)
	.POST("/person", handler::createPerson)
	.build();


public class PersonHandler {

	// ...

	public Mono<ServerResponse> listPeople(ServerRequest request) {
		// ...
	}

	public Mono<ServerResponse> createPerson(ServerRequest request) {
		// ...
	}

	public Mono<ServerResponse> getPerson(ServerRequest request) {
		// ...
	}
}
----
====

One way to run a `RouterFunction` is to turn it into an `HttpHandler` and install it
through one of the built-in <<web-reactive.adoc#webflux-httphandler, server adapters>>:

* `RouterFunctions.toHttpHandler(RouterFunction)`
* `RouterFunctions.toHttpHandler(RouterFunction, HandlerStrategies)`

Most applications can run through the WebFlux Java configuration, see <<webflux-fn-running>>.




[[webflux-fn-handler-functions]]
== HandlerFunction

`ServerRequest` and `ServerResponse` are immutable interfaces that offer JDK 8-friendly
access to the HTTP request and response.
Both request and response provide https://www.reactive-streams.org[Reactive Streams] back pressure
against the body streams.
The request body is represented with a Reactor `Flux` or `Mono`.
The response body is represented with any Reactive Streams `Publisher`, including `Flux` and `Mono`.
For more on that, see <<web-reactive.adoc#webflux-reactive-libraries, Reactive Libraries>>.



[[webflux-fn-request]]
=== `ServerRequest`

`ServerRequest` provides access to the HTTP method, URI, headers, and query parameters,
while access to the body is provided through the `body` methods.

The following example extracts the request body to a `Mono<String>`:

====
[source,java]
----
Mono<String> string = request.bodyToMono(String.class);
----
====

The following example extracts the body to a `Flux<Person>`, where `Person` objects are decoded from some
serialized form, such as JSON or XML:

====
[source,java]
----
Flux<Person> people = request.bodyToFlux(Person.class);
----
====

The preceding examples are shortcuts that use the more general `ServerRequest.body(BodyExtractor)`,
which accepts the `BodyExtractor` functional strategy interface. The utility class
`BodyExtractors` provides access to a number of instances. For example, the preceding examples can
also be written as follows:

====
[source,java]
----
Mono<String> string = request.body(BodyExtractors.toMono(String.class));
Flux<Person> people = request.body(BodyExtractors.toFlux(Person.class));
----
====

The following example shows how to access form data:

====
[source,java]
----
Mono<MultiValueMap<String, String> map = request.body(BodyExtractors.toFormData());
----
====

The following example shows how to access multipart data as a map:

====
[source,java]
----
Mono<MultiValueMap<String, Part> map = request.body(BodyExtractors.toMultipartData());
----
====

The following example shows how to access multiparts, one at a time, in streaming fashion:

====
[source,java]
----
Flux<Part> parts = request.body(BodyExtractors.toParts());
----
====



[[webflux-fn-response]]
=== `ServerResponse`

`ServerResponse` provides access to the HTTP response and, since it is immutable, you can use
a `build` method to create it. You can use the builder to set the response status, to add response
headers, or to provide a body. The following example creates a 200 (OK) response with JSON
content:

====
[source,java]
----
Mono<Person> person = ...
ServerResponse.ok().contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON).body(person, Person.class);
----
====

The following example shows how to build a 201 (CREATED) response with a `Location` header and no body:

====
[source,java]
----
URI location = ...
ServerResponse.created(location).build();
----
====

Depending on the codec used, it is possible to pass hint parameters to customize how the
body is serialized or deserialized. For example, to specify a https://www.baeldung.com/jackson-json-view-annotation[Jackson JSON view]:

====
[source,java]
----
ServerResponse.ok().hint(Jackson2CodecSupport.JSON_VIEW_HINT, MyJacksonView.class).body(...);
----
====


[[webflux-fn-handler-classes]]
=== Handler Classes

We can write a handler function as a lambda, as the following example shows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
HandlerFunction<ServerResponse> helloWorld =
  request -> ServerResponse.ok().body(fromObject("Hello World"));
----
====

That is convenient, but in an application we need multiple functions, and multiple inline
lambda's can get messy.
Therefore, it is useful to group related handler functions together into a handler class, which
has a similar role as  `@Controller` in an annotation-based application.
For example, the following class exposes a reactive `Person` repository:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
import static org.springframework.http.MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON;
import static org.springframework.web.reactive.function.ServerResponse.ok;
import static org.springframework.web.reactive.function.BodyInserters.fromObject;

public class PersonHandler {

	private final PersonRepository repository;

	public PersonHandler(PersonRepository repository) {
		this.repository = repository;
	}

	public Mono<ServerResponse> listPeople(ServerRequest request) { // <1>
		Flux<Person> people = repository.allPeople();
		return ok().contentType(APPLICATION_JSON).body(people, Person.class);
	}

	public Mono<ServerResponse> createPerson(ServerRequest request) { // <2>
		Mono<Person> person = request.bodyToMono(Person.class);
		return ok().build(repository.savePerson(person));
	}

	public Mono<ServerResponse> getPerson(ServerRequest request) { // <3>
		int personId = Integer.valueOf(request.pathVariable("id"));
		return repository.getPerson(personId)
			.flatMap(person -> ok().contentType(APPLICATION_JSON).body(fromObject(person)))
			.switchIfEmpty(ServerResponse.notFound().build());
	}
}
----
<1> `listPeople` is a handler function that returns all `Person` objects found in the repository as
JSON.
<2> `createPerson` is a handler function that stores a new `Person` contained in the request body.
Note that `PersonRepository.savePerson(Person)` returns `Mono<Void>`: an empty `Mono` that emits
a completion signal when the person has been read from the request and stored. So we use the
`build(Publisher<Void>)` method to send a response when that completion signal is received (that is,
when the `Person` has been saved).
<3> `getPerson` is a handler function that returns a single person, identified by the `id` path
variable. We retrieve that `Person` from the repository and create a JSON response, if it is
found. If it is not found, we use `switchIfEmpty(Mono<T>)` to return a 404 Not Found response.
====



[[webflux-fn-handler-validation]]
=== Validation

A functional endpoint can use Spring's <<core.adoc#validation, validation facilities>> to
apply validation to the request body. For example, given a custom Spring
<<core.adoc#validation, Validator>> implementation for a `Person`:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
public class PersonHandler {

	private final Validator validator = new PersonValidator(); // <1>

	// ...

	public Mono<ServerResponse> createPerson(ServerRequest request) {
		Mono<Person> person = request.bodyToMono(Person.class).doOnNext(this::validate); <2>
		return ok().build(repository.savePerson(person));
	}

	private void validate(Person person) {
		Errors errors = new BeanPropertyBindingResult(body, "person");
		validator.validate(body, errors);
		if (errors.hasErrors) {
			throw new ServerWebInputException(errors.toString()); <3>
		}
	}

----
<1> Create `Validator` instance.
<2> Apply validation.
<3> Raise exception for a 400 response.
====

Handlers can also use the standard bean validation API (JSR-303) by creating and injecting
a global `Validator` instance based on `LocalValidatorFactoryBean`.
See <<core.adoc#validation-beanvalidation, Spring Validation>>.



[[webflux-fn-router-functions]]
== `RouterFunction`

Router functions are used to route the requests to the corresponding `HandlerFunction`.
Typically, you do not write router functions yourself, but rather use a method on the
`RouterFunctions` utility class to create one.
`RouterFunctions.route()` (no parameters) provides you with a fluent builder for creating a router
function, whereas `RouterFunctions.route(RequestPredicate, HandlerFunction)` offers a direct way
to create a router.

Generally, it is recommended to use the `route()` builder, as it provides
convenient short-cuts for typical mapping scenarios without requiring hard-to-discover
static imports.
For instance, the router function builder offers the method `GET(String, HandlerFunction)` to create a mapping for GET requests; and `POST(String, HandlerFunction)` for POSTs.

Besides HTTP method-based mapping, the route builder offers a way to introduce additional
predicates when mapping to requests.
For each HTTP method there is an overloaded variant that takes a `RequestPredicate` as a
parameter, though which additional constraints can be expressed.


[[webflux-fn-predicates]]
=== Predicates

You can write your own `RequestPredicate`, but the `RequestPredicates` utility class
offers commonly used implementations, based on the request path, HTTP method, content-type,
and so on.
The following example uses a request predicate to create a constraint based on the `Accept`
header:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
RouterFunction<ServerResponse> route = RouterFunctions.route()
	.GET("/hello-world", accept(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN),
		request -> Response.ok().body(fromObject("Hello World")));
----
====

You can compose multiple request predicates together by using:

* `RequestPredicate.and(RequestPredicate)` -- both must match.
* `RequestPredicate.or(RequestPredicate)` -- either can match.

Many of the predicates from `RequestPredicates` are composed.
For example, `RequestPredicates.GET(String)` is composed from `RequestPredicates.method(HttpMethod)`
and `RequestPredicates.path(String)`.
The example shown above also uses two request predicates, as the builder uses
`RequestPredicates.GET` internally, and composes that with the `accept` predicate.



[[webflux-fn-routes]]
=== Routes

Router functions are evaluated in order: if the first route does not match, the
second is evaluated, and so on.
Therefore, it makes sense to declare more specific routes before general ones.
Note that this behavior is different from the annotation-based programming model, where the
"most specific" controller method is picked automatically.

When using the router function builder, all defined routes are composed into one
`RouterFunction` that is returned from `build()`.
There are also other ways to compose multiple router functions together:

* `add(RouterFunction)` on the `RouterFunctions.route()` builder
* `RouterFunction.and(RouterFunction)`
* `RouterFunction.andRoute(RequestPredicate, HandlerFunction)` -- shortcut for
`RouterFunction.and()` with nested `RouterFunctions.route()`.

The following example shows the composition of four routes:


====
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
import static org.springframework.http.MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON;
import static org.springframework.web.reactive.function.server.RequestPredicates.*;

PersonRepository repository = ...
PersonHandler handler = new PersonHandler(repository);

RouterFunction<ServerResponse> otherRoute = ...

RouterFunction<ServerResponse> route = route()
	.GET("/person/{id}", accept(APPLICATION_JSON), handler::getPerson) // <1>
	.GET("/person", accept(APPLICATION_JSON), handler::listPeople) // <2>
	.POST("/person", handler::createPerson) // <3>
	.add(otherRoute) // <4>
	.build();
----
<1> `GET /person/{id}` with an `Accept` header that matches JSON is routed to
`PersonHandler.getPerson`
<2> `GET /person` with an `Accept` header that matches JSON is routed to
`PersonHandler.listPeople`
<3> `POST /person` with no additional predicates is mapped to
`PersonHandler.createPerson`, and
<4> `otherRoute` is a router function that is created elsewhere, and added to the route built.

====


=== Nested Routes

It is common for a group of router functions to have a shared predicate, for instance a shared
path.
In the example above, the shared predicate would be a path predicate that matches `/person`,
used by three of the routes.
When using annotations, you would remove this duplication by using a type-level `@RequestMapping`
 annotation that maps to `/person`.
In WebFlux.fn, path predicates can be shared through the `path` method on the router function builder.
For instance, the last few lines of the example above can be improved in the following way by using nested routes:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
RouterFunction<ServerResponse> route = route()
	.path("/person", builder -> builder
		.GET("/{id}", accept(APPLICATION_JSON), handler::getPerson)
		.GET("", accept(APPLICATION_JSON), handler::listPeople)
		.POST("/person", handler::createPerson))
	.build();
----
====

Note that second parameter of `path` is a consumer that takes the a router builder.

Though path-based nesting is the most common, you can nest on any kind of predicate by using
the `nest` method on the builder.
The above still contains some duplication in the form of the shared `Accept`-header predicate.
We can further improve by using the `nest` method together with `accept`:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
RouterFunction<ServerResponse> route = route()
	.path("/person", b1 -> b1
		.nest(accept(APPLICATION_JSON), b2 -> b2
			.GET("/{id}", handler::getPerson)
			.GET("", handler::listPeople))
		.POST("/person", handler::createPerson))
	.build();
----
====


[[webflux-fn-running]]
== Running a Server

How do you run a router function in an HTTP server? A simple option is to convert a router
function to an `HttpHandler` by using one of the following:

* `RouterFunctions.toHttpHandler(RouterFunction)`
* `RouterFunctions.toHttpHandler(RouterFunction, HandlerStrategies)`

You can then use the returned `HttpHandler` with a number of server adapters by following
<<web-reactive.adoc#webflux-httphandler, HttpHandler>> for server-specific instructions.

A more typical option, also used by Spring Boot, is to run with a
<<web-reactive.adoc#webflux-dispatcher-handler, `DispatcherHandler`>>-based setup through the
<<web-reactive.adoc#webflux-config>>, which uses Spring configuration to declare the
components required to process requests. The WebFlux Java configuration declares the following
infrastructure components to support functional endpoints:

* `RouterFunctionMapping`: Detects one or more `RouterFunction<?>` beans in the Spring
configuration, combines them through `RouterFunction.andOther`, and routes requests to the
resulting composed `RouterFunction`.
* `HandlerFunctionAdapter`: Simple adapter that lets `DispatcherHandler` invoke
a `HandlerFunction` that was mapped to a request.
* `ServerResponseResultHandler`: Handles the result from the invocation of a
`HandlerFunction` by invoking the `writeTo` method of the `ServerResponse`.

The preceding components let functional endpoints fit within the `DispatcherHandler` request
processing lifecycle and also (potentially) run side by side with annotated controllers, if
any are declared. It is also how functional endpoints are enabled by the Spring Boot WebFlux
starter.

The following example shows a WebFlux Java configuration (see
<<web-reactive.adoc#webflux-dispatcher-handler, DispatcherHandler>> for how to run it):

====
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@Configuration
@EnableWebFlux
public class WebConfig implements WebFluxConfigurer {

	@Bean
	public RouterFunction<?> routerFunctionA() {
		// ...
	}

	@Bean
	public RouterFunction<?> routerFunctionB() {
		// ...
	}

	// ...

	@Override
	public void configureHttpMessageCodecs(ServerCodecConfigurer configurer) {
		// configure message conversion...
	}

	@Override
	public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
		// configure CORS...
	}

	@Override
	public void configureViewResolvers(ViewResolverRegistry registry) {
		// configure view resolution for HTML rendering...
	}
}
----
====




[[webflux-fn-handler-filter-function]]
== Filtering Handler Functions

You can filter handler functions by using the `before`, `after`, or `filter` methods on the routing
function builder.
With annotations, you can achieve similar functionality by using `@ControllerAdvice`, a `ServletFilter`, or both.
The filter will apply to all routes that are built by the builder.
This means that filters defined in nested routes do not apply to "top-level" routes.
For instance, consider the following example:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
RouterFunction<ServerResponse> route = route()
	.path("/person", b1 -> b1
		.nest(accept(APPLICATION_JSON), b2 -> b2
			.GET("/{id}", handler::getPerson)
			.GET("", handler::listPeople)
			.before(request -> ServerRequest.from(request) // <1>
				.header("X-RequestHeader", "Value")
				.build()))
		.POST("/person", handler::createPerson))
	.after((request, response) -> logResponse(response)) // <2>
	.build();
----
<1> The `before` filter that adds a custom request header is only applied to the two GET routes.
<2> The `after` filter that logs the response is applied to all routes, including the nested ones.
====

The `filter` method on the router builder takes a `HandlerFilterFunction`: a
function that takes a `ServerRequest` and `HandlerFunction` and returns a `ServerResponse`.
The handler function parameter represents the next element in the chain.
This is typically the handler that is routed to, but it can also be another
filter if multiple are applied.

Now we can add a simple security filter to our route, assuming that we have a `SecurityManager` that
can determine whether a particular path is allowed.
The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----

SecurityManager securityManager = ...

RouterFunction<ServerResponse> route = route()
	.path("/person", b1 -> b1
		.nest(accept(APPLICATION_JSON), b2 -> b2
			.GET("/{id}", handler::getPerson)
			.GET("", handler::listPeople))
		.POST("/person", handler::createPerson))
	.filter((request, next) -> {
		if (securityManager.allowAccessTo(request.path())) {
			return next.handle(request);
		}
		else {
			return ServerResponse.status(UNAUTHORIZED).build();
		}
	})
	.build();
----
====

The preceding example demonstrates that invoking the `next.handle(ServerRequest)` is optional.
We allow only the handler function to be executed when access is allowed.

Besides using the `filter` method on the router function builder, it is possible to apply a
filter to an existing router function via `RouterFunction.filter(HandlerFilterFunction)`.

NOTE: CORS support for functional endpoints is provided through a dedicated
<<webflux-cors-webfilter, `CorsWebFilter`>>.
