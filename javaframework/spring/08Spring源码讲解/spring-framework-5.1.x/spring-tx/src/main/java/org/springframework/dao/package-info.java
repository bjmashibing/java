/**
 * Exception hierarchy enabling sophisticated error handling independent
 * of the data access approach in use. For example, when DAOs and data
 * access frameworks use the exceptions in this package (and custom
 * subclasses), calling code can detect and handle common problems such
 * as deadlocks without being tied to a particular data access strategy,
 * such as JDBC.
 *
 * <p>All these exceptions are unchecked, meaning that calling code can
 * leave them uncaught and treat all data access exceptions as fatal.
 *
 * <p>The classes in this package are discussed in Chapter 9 of
 * <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0764543857/">Expert One-On-One J2EE Design and Development</a>
 * by Rod Johnson (Wrox, 2002).
