/**
 * Callback interface for extracting a result object from a CCI Record instance.
 *
 * <p>Used for output object creation in CciTemplate. Alternatively, output
 * Records can also be returned to client code as-is. In case of a CCI ResultSet
 * as execution result, you will almost always want to implement a RecordExtractor,
 * to be able to read the ResultSet in a managed fashion, with the CCI Connection
 * still open while reading the ResultSet.
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this interface perform the actual work of extracting
 * results, but don't need to worry about exception handling. ResourceExceptions
 * will be caught and handled correctly by the CciTemplate class.
