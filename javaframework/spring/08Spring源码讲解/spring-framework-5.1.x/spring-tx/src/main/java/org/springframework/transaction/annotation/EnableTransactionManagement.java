/**
 * Enables Spring's annotation-driven transaction management capability, similar to
 * the support found in Spring's {@code <tx:*>} XML namespace. To be used on
 * {@link org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration @Configuration}
 * classes as follows:
 *
 * <pre class="code">
 * &#064;Configuration
 * &#064;EnableTransactionManagement
 * public class AppConfig {
 *
 *     &#064;Bean
 *     public FooRepository fooRepository() {
 *         // configure and return a class having &#064;Transactional methods
 *         return new JdbcFooRepository(dataSource());
 *     }
 *
 *     &#064;Bean
 *     public DataSource dataSource() {
 *         // configure and return the necessary JDBC DataSource
 *     }
 *
 *     &#064;Bean
 *     public PlatformTransactionManager txManager() {
 *         return new DataSourceTransactionManager(dataSource());
 *     }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>For reference, the example above can be compared to the following Spring XML
 * configuration:
 *
 * <pre class="code">
 * &lt;beans&gt;
 *
 *     &lt;tx:annotation-driven/&gt;
 *
 *     &lt;bean id="fooRepository" class="com.foo.JdbcFooRepository"&gt;
 *         &lt;constructor-arg ref="dataSource"/&gt;
 *     &lt;/bean&gt;
 *
 *     &lt;bean id="dataSource" class="com.vendor.VendorDataSource"/&gt;
 *
 *     &lt;bean id="transactionManager" class="org.sfwk...DataSourceTransactionManager"&gt;
 *         &lt;constructor-arg ref="dataSource"/&gt;
 *     &lt;/bean&gt;
 *
 * &lt;/beans&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * In both of the scenarios above, {@code @EnableTransactionManagement} and {@code
 * <tx:annotation-driven/>} are responsible for registering the necessary Spring
 * components that power annotation-driven transaction management, such as the
 * TransactionInterceptor and the proxy- or AspectJ-based advice that weave the
 * interceptor into the call stack when {@code JdbcFooRepository}'s {@code @Transactional}
 * methods are invoked.
 *
 * <p>A minor difference between the two examples lies in the naming of the {@code
 * PlatformTransactionManager} bean: In the {@code @Bean} case, the name is
 * <em>"txManager"</em> (per the name of the method); in the XML case, the name is
 * <em>"transactionManager"</em>. The {@code <tx:annotation-driven/>} is hard-wired to
 * look for a bean named "transactionManager" by default, however
 * {@code @EnableTransactionManagement} is more flexible; it will fall back to a by-type
 * lookup for any {@code PlatformTransactionManager} bean in the container. Thus the name
 * can be "txManager", "transactionManager", or "tm": it simply does not matter.
 *
 * <p>For those that wish to establish a more direct relationship between
 * {@code @EnableTransactionManagement} and the exact transaction manager bean to be used,
 * the {@link TransactionManagementConfigurer} callback interface may be implemented -
 * notice the {@code implements} clause and the {@code @Override}-annotated method below:
 *
 * <pre class="code">
 * &#064;Configuration
 * &#064;EnableTransactionManagement
 * public class AppConfig implements TransactionManagementConfigurer {
 *
 *     &#064;Bean
 *     public FooRepository fooRepository() {
 *         // configure and return a class having &#064;Transactional methods
 *         return new JdbcFooRepository(dataSource());
 *     }
 *
 *     &#064;Bean
 *     public DataSource dataSource() {
 *         // configure and return the necessary JDBC DataSource
 *     }
 *
 *     &#064;Bean
 *     public PlatformTransactionManager txManager() {
 *         return new DataSourceTransactionManager(dataSource());
 *     }
 *
 *     &#064;Override
 *     public PlatformTransactionManager annotationDrivenTransactionManager() {
 *         return txManager();
 *     }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * This approach may be desirable simply because it is more explicit, or it may be
 * necessary in order to distinguish between two {@code PlatformTransactionManager} beans
 * present in the same container.  As the name suggests, the
 * {@code annotationDrivenTransactionManager()} will be the one used for processing
 * {@code @Transactional} methods. See {@link TransactionManagementConfigurer} Javadoc
 * for further details.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #mode} attribute controls how advice is applied: If the mode is
 * {@link AdviceMode#PROXY} (the default), then the other attributes control the behavior
 * of the proxying. Please note that proxy mode allows for interception of calls through
 * the proxy only; local calls within the same class cannot get intercepted that way.
 *
 * <p>Note that if the {@linkplain #mode} is set to {@link AdviceMode#ASPECTJ}, then the
 * value of the {@link #proxyTargetClass} attribute will be ignored. Note also that in
 * this case the {@code spring-aspects} module JAR must be present on the classpath, with
 * compile-time weaving or load-time weaving applying the aspect to the affected classes.
 * There is no proxy involved in such a scenario; local calls will be intercepted as well.
