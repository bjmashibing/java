/**
 * Implementation of the CCI RecordFactory interface that always throws
 * NotSupportedException.
 *
 * <p>Useful as a placeholder for a RecordFactory argument (for example as
 * defined by the RecordCreator callback), in particular when the connector's
 * {@code ConnectionFactory.getRecordFactory()} implementation happens to
 * throw NotSupportedException early rather than throwing the exception from
 * RecordFactory's methods.
