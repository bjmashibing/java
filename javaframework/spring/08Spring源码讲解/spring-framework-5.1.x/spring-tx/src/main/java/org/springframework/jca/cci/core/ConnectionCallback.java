/**
 * Generic callback interface for code that operates on a CCI Connection.
 * Allows to execute any number of operations on a single Connection,
 * using any type and number of Interaction.
 *
 * <p>This is particularly useful for delegating to existing data access code
 * that expects a Connection to work on and throws ResourceException. For newly
 * written code, it is strongly recommended to use CciTemplate's more specific
 * {@code execute} variants.

	 * Gets called by {@code CciTemplate.execute} with an active CCI Connection.
	 * Does not need to care about activating or closing the Connection, or handling
	 * transactions.
	 * <p>If called without a thread-bound CCI transaction (initiated by
	 * CciLocalTransactionManager), the code will simply get executed on the CCI
	 * Connection with its transactional semantics. If CciTemplate is configured
	 * to use a JTA-aware ConnectionFactory, the CCI Connection and thus the callback
	 * code will be transactional if a JTA transaction is active.
	 * <p>Allows for returning a result object created within the callback, i.e.
	 * a domain object or a collection of domain objects. Note that there's special
	 * support for single step actions: see the {@code CciTemplate.execute}
	 * variants. A thrown RuntimeException is treated as application exception:
	 * it gets propagated to the caller of the template.
	 * @param connection active CCI Connection
	 * @param connectionFactory the CCI ConnectionFactory that the Connection was
	 * created with (gives access to RecordFactory and ResourceAdapterMetaData)
	 * @return a result object, or {@code null} if none
	 * @throws ResourceException if thrown by a CCI method, to be auto-converted
	 * to a DataAccessException
