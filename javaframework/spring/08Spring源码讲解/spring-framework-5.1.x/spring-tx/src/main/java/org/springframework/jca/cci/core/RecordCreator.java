/**
 * Callback interface for creating a CCI Record instance,
 * usually based on the passed-in CCI RecordFactory.
 *
 * <p>Used for input Record creation in CciTemplate. Alternatively,
 * Record instances can be passed into CciTemplate's corresponding
 * {@code execute} methods directly, either instantiated manually
 * or created through CciTemplate's Record factory methods.
 *
 * <P>Also used for creating default output Records in CciTemplate.
 * This is useful when the JCA connector needs an explicit output Record
 * instance, but no output Records should be passed into CciTemplate's
 * {@code execute} methods.
