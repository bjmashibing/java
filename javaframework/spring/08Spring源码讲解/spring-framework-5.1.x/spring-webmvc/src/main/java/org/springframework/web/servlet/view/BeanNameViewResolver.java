/**
 * A simple implementation of {@link org.springframework.web.servlet.ViewResolver}
 * that interprets a view name as a bean name in the current application context,
 * i.e. typically in the XML file of the executing {@code DispatcherServlet}.
 *
 * <p>This resolver can be handy for small applications, keeping all definitions
 * ranging from controllers to views in the same place. For larger applications,
 * {@link XmlViewResolver} will be the better choice, as it separates the XML
 * view bean definitions into a dedicated views file.
 *
 * <p>Note: Neither this {@code ViewResolver} nor {@link XmlViewResolver} supports
 * internationalization. Consider {@link ResourceBundleViewResolver} if you need
 * to apply different view resources per locale.
 *
 * <p>Note: This {@code ViewResolver} implements the {@link Ordered} interface
 * in order to allow for flexible participation in {@code ViewResolver} chaining.
 * For example, some special views could be defined via this {@code ViewResolver}
 * (giving it 0 as "order" value), while all remaining views could be resolved by
 * a {@link UrlBasedViewResolver}.
