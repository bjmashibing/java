/**
 * Interface for web-based theme resolution strategies that allows for
 * both theme resolution via the request and theme modification via
 * request and response.
 *
 * <p>This interface allows for implementations based on session,
 * cookies, etc. The default implementation is
 * {@link org.springframework.web.servlet.theme.FixedThemeResolver},
 * simply using a configured default theme.
 *
 * <p>Note that this resolver is only responsible for determining the
 * current theme name. The Theme instance for the resolved theme name
 * gets looked up by DispatcherServlet via the respective ThemeSource,
 * i.e. the current WebApplicationContext.
 *
 * <p>Use {@link org.springframework.web.servlet.support.RequestContext#getTheme()}
 * to retrieve the current theme in controllers or views, independent
 * of the actual resolution strategy.
