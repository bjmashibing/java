/**
 * Concrete AspectJ transaction aspect using the JTA 1.2
 * {@link javax.transaction.Transactional} annotation.
 *
 * <p>When using this aspect, you <i>must</i> annotate the implementation class
 * (and/or methods within that class), <i>not</i> the interface (if any) that
 * the class implements. AspectJ follows Java's rule that annotations on
 * interfaces are <i>not</i> inherited.
 *
 * <p>An @Transactional annotation on a class specifies the default transaction
 * semantics for the execution of any <b>public</b> operation in the class.
 *
 * <p>An @Transactional annotation on a method within the class overrides the
 * default transaction semantics given by the class annotation (if present).
 * Any method may be annotated (regardless of visibility). Annotating
 * non-public methods directly is the only way to get transaction demarcation
 * for the execution of such operations.
