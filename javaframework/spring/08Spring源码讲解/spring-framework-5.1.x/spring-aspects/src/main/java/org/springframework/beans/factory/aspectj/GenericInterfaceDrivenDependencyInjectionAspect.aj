/**
 * Generic-based dependency injection aspect.
 *
 * <p>This aspect allows users to implement efficient, type-safe dependency injection
 * without the use of the {@code @Configurable} annotation.
 *
 * <p>The subaspect of this aspect doesn't need to include any AOP constructs. For
 * example, here is a subaspect that configures the {@code PricingStrategyClient} objects.
 *
 * <pre class="code">
 * aspect PricingStrategyDependencyInjectionAspect
 *        extends GenericInterfaceDrivenDependencyInjectionAspect<PricingStrategyClient> {
 *     private PricingStrategy pricingStrategy;
 *
 *     public void configure(PricingStrategyClient bean) {
 *         bean.setPricingStrategy(pricingStrategy);
 *     }
 *
 *     public void setPricingStrategy(PricingStrategy pricingStrategy) {
 *         this.pricingStrategy = pricingStrategy;
 *     }
 * }</pre>
