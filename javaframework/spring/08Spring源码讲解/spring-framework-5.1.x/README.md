This is the home of the Spring Framework: the foundation for all [Spring projects](https://spring.io/projects). Collectively the Spring Framework and the family of Spring projects is often referred to simply as "Spring". 

Spring provides everything required beyond the Java programming language for creating enterprise applications for a wide range of scenarios and architectures. Please read the [Overview](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/overview.html#spring-introduction) section as reference for a more complete introduction.
