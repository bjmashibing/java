/**
 * HTTP request handler that exports the specified service bean as
 * HTTP invoker service endpoint, accessible via an HTTP invoker proxy.
 * Designed for Sun's JRE 1.6 HTTP server, implementing the
 * {@link com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpHandler} interface.
 *
 * <p>Deserializes remote invocation objects and serializes remote invocation
 * result objects. Uses Java serialization just like RMI, but provides the
 * same ease of setup as Caucho's HTTP-based Hessian protocol.
 *
 * <p><b>HTTP invoker is the recommended protocol for Java-to-Java remoting.</b>
 * It is more powerful and more extensible than Hessian, at the expense of
 * being tied to Java. Nevertheless, it is as easy to set up as Hessian,
 * which is its main advantage compared to RMI.
 *
 * <p><b>WARNING: Be aware of vulnerabilities due to unsafe Java deserialization:
 * Manipulated input streams could lead to unwanted code execution on the server
 * during the deserialization step. As a consequence, do not expose HTTP invoker
 * endpoints to untrusted clients but rather just between your own services.</b>
 * In general, we strongly recommend any other message format (e.g. JSON) instead.
