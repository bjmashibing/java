/**
 * Spring's variant of the

 *
 * <p>This {@code impl} package is only present for binary compatibility
 * with existing Commons Logging usage, e.g. in Commons Configuration.
 * {@code NoOpLog} can be used as a {@code Log} fallback instance, and
 * {@code SimpleLog} is not meant to work (issuing a warning when used).
